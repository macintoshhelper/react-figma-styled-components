# react-figma styled-components example

Demo of a cross-platform React component library built with `styled-components`, that renders out to a Figma design. This could be used to build a component library with the `<Component>` export in https://github.com/react-figma/react-figma

(inspired by: https://github.com/airbnb/react-sketchapp/blob/master/examples/styled-components/src/my-command.js)
